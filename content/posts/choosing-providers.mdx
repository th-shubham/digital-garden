## Analytics

### Vercel

To configure, you need to enable it on [Vercel project dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) by selecting your Project and then click the Analytics tab and click Enable from the dialog.

### Umami

Umami is a simple, easy to use, web analytics solution with self-hosting option! You can read more about it on [Umami website](https://umami.is/). _(Hint: On [Railway](https://railway.app), you can self-host it low cost or even free)_.

Configure:
Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL` & `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` environment variables on your `.env.local` file and on Vercel dashboard.

### Others

Supporting other analytics providers are in progress. Feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions or a PR if you want to implement it yourself.

### Newsletter subscription

_WIP_ as I'm still deciding which email tools to support. Feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions or a PR if you want to implement it yourself.
